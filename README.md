Use this github repository to issue bug reports on Intave.

## When to use an issue tracker
Use this tracker if the issue is not urgent, but you want it fixed definetly.

## When to use direct communication
For short term bug communication we use [discord](https://intave.de/go/discord).
Post issues there if you expect them to be fixed within days.
Just know that they will most likely get buried there if we can't find an immediate solution.

## I am a player, I don't own the product
Reporting issues is not a customers privilege, you can do so too!
Check if your network provides any game ids we can use to request logs for.
